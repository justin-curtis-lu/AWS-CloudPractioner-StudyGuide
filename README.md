# Cloud Concepts

### Cloud computing

- on demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet
- **increased speed and agility**:  Decreased acquisition time for new compute resources
- **stop spending money on running data centers**
- only pay when you consume the resources ( **trade capital expense for variable expense** )
- **Massive economies of scale**
- **Don't need to guess capacity** â†’ Can scale up or down accordingly
- Launches rapidly instead of waiting weeks for IT to implement
- **global in minutes** ( multiple regions )
- Use loosely coupled components.
    - that way if one service fails, everything else is still good
- assume everything will fail
- Implement elasticity
    - this means we "create systems that scale to required capacity on changes in demand"
    - this does NOT mean that we spread the load across regions
    - this does NOT mean that we divert to instances with higher capacity
- Design for scalability
- using API, allows cloud resources to be managed progammatically

### Deployment Models

**On-Premise Deployment**

- private cloud deployment
- resources deployed on premise by using virtualization
- Eg: Banks

**Cloud**

- fully utilize cloud computing
- run, migrate, design entirely for the cloud
- Eg: Startups

**Hybrid**

- using both cloud and on-premise
- Eg: Company
